What is Program?
    . A program is a file containing a set of set of instructions which tells the computer how to do something.

    . A program can :
        * Take in Information: 
            from files, other programs and services, sensors attached to the computer, or user
            behaviour like typing or useing the mouse.
        * Transform the information: 
            By doing math, looking things up comparing things , etc.
        * Output information: 
            back to the user, in the form of tesxt, images, files, or control of devices that are connected to the computer.
    
    . To write a program, you need to speak the computers language !

What is a Language ?

    . A language is a way of communicating. It has words, syntax, structure, and meanings.
        programming languages are let humans communicate to the computer!
    . Computers are dumb:
        By executing a program, you will cause the computer to follow exactly, and only, the instruction you have given it - whether they make
        sense or not! Learning to program means learning to communicate precisely.
    . A programming language is built for exact communications:
        That means that there are relatively few words and structures, which we will reuse over and over.
    . Learning a language means learning to read the instructions:
        You'll learn not only to write the code yourself, but to read and analyze code supplied by ChatGPT, coming to understand what the computer
        would do if it received these instructions, and why.

What is Compiler or Interpreter ?

    They are the translator for us which translate our human readable code to machine understandable code.
    Because the computers only know 0 1 and nothing else.

Learning the words:

    . Language Keywords:
        define the human-readable instructions we can give to the computer
    . Jargon or specialized vocabulary: 
        will help you talk to other programmers about programming, and understand how to read documentation that you find.
    . You've already learned a few such words, like program and instrction.
      Here are few more:
        . Script:
            A program written in a language that needs an interpreter program (like Python) in order to be executred.
        . IDE:
              An interactive Development Environment, like PyCharm, which adds tools to make development quicker and easier.
